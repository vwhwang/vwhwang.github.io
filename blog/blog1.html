          <h3>2 Months Mark at Ada!</h3>
          <time>March 26, 2020</time>
          <p>
            First of all I want to give myself a huge round-of-applause. “Hey Vicki, you have been coding full time for 2 months now!”.
            Life sure is good with me coding full time. I feel challenged and happy learning with everyone at Ada. Concepts of object-oriented programming, what does it mean to be in scope, test driven development etc.</p>
          <p>Some reflections:</p>
          <p>Things that I find satisfying: 
            <ul>
              <li>Writing the tests first and see them go green with rake on ruby after I completed the project. </li>
              <li>Getting familiar with command line terminal and VS code. I feel pretty cool just touching and git commiting… </li>
              <li>
                Solving challenges, even it may take hours, and my code seems way longer than my fellow classmates… but it feels amazing when my code works.
                </li>
              <li>Completing bigger projects! I feel invincible and joyful when my code works! 
              </li>
              <li>Learning with amazing people at Ada, maybe I have been out of school for a while. But I think it’s one of the best feelings when everyone there has the same goal and interest in coding. I am so proud of us. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Things that are weird and interesting: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why in the world is my code not doing what I want it to. Bug, bug, bug… where are you bug? Are you really a bug or is it my design? 
            </li>
            <li>
              Dreaming of coding and swear that I have thought of the solution but too bad it was lost in my dream… head? 
              </li>
              <li>
                Can’t sleep well for the first time because I can’t stop thinking about how to solve that coding challenge…
                </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          To sum up, I have been coding and learning ruby, HTML, CSS etc. in the last 2 months with Ada. And can not wait to continue my journey on becoming a software developer. Coding is super fun, if I can, you can too. </p>
          <p>Side note: We have been online since the coronavirus outbreak. I hope everyone is doing well home. Ada has been amazing at a hard time like this. I feel so supported and I believe our community will grow stronger and closer.

        <p>Some feelings:
        <ul>
          <li>Wow I am really here working as a developer!</li>
          <li> Work flies by so fast everyday, which is such a pleasant feeling that things are going well and I am
            enjoying what I do!</li>
          <li>
            Coding is still hard, but I am learning to be comfortably uncomfortable!
          </li>
          <li>Some days I am John Snow - “You know nothing, John Snow.”
          </li>
          <li>Some days I feel awesome, it was totally me, definitely not luck on solving that UI issue.</li>
          <li>Need to study more on Kotlin, but it’s the weekend! YEP GOING TO ENJOY MY WEEKEND AND write about how
            awesome
            I am. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Reflections and Learnings:</p>
        <p><ins>“You don’t have to code everything out on your own.”</ins> <br>Before where I am now, I thought I am
          expected to code everything out on my own, be able to code features and make shit happen. Well, I still code
          things and make things happen. BUT with my awesome team’s help! And that’s totally ok!
        </p>
        <p><ins>“Communication is not easy."</ins> <br>I thought since I like to talk, I should be fine on reaching out to people/communications. I was wrong… How do I
          convey technical concepts, how do I convey what I tried and want to solve, how do I ask the right questions, how
          do I ask for help and understand what others are saying, how do I work with design and other engineers etc. I
          think I just need to be patient with myself and learn from experiences and others :)
        </p>
        <p><ins>“Slow down a bit for myself to absorb new learnings.”</ins> <br>Some things are hard, and I might ask for help to get the answers to solve a task. As I completed the task and
          move on, I think it’s important to make sure I understand or at least have a high level of understanding the
          solution or implementations.
        </p>
        <p>Work in progress stuff:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get better at completing tasks with less help as I learn more things! </li>
            <li>Understand one small concept every week. (Could be something small, but I’d like to be able to explain it thoroughly)</li>
            <li>Continue on getting help and helping others for an awesome team/work environment. </li>
            <li>Be myself.</li>
              <li>Try not to work more than 8 hours a day! </li>
          </ul>
